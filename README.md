# Caesar Cipher Project #2 - Data Structures, Performance Testing, and Unit Testing

Written in C, this script should take in encrypted text in the stdin and output the decrypted text and the cipher shift that it was encrypted with. This was done by comparing all the combinations of cipher shifts with a known dictionary. The script outputs all the results to a solutions.txt file. Finally, unit tests are also added to ensure the program is working correctly.

The hash table used in improving the performance of this program uses the djb2 hash function. This was found here. http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~oz/hash.html

## Build

This was tested on an Ubuntu VM using cmake v3.16.3 (https://cmake.org/). In the project directory run the commands below:

NOTE: Google Test is now required to build this project to run the unit tests. I used the instructions at https://github.com/gkthiruvathukal/googletest-mva to download and install this testing framework on MacOS and Linux.

```bash
cmake .
```
Then run the command: 
```bash
make
```

## Run Tests

This program also includes 15 unit tests that are able to ensure the program is running properly. These tests are useful when building the application and checking to make sure modifications to these functions did not break the expected behavior.

To run the tests, run the following command:
```bash
./run_all_tests
```

## Usage

There are 2 main ways to run this script.

#### 1. Manual Input
This method will allow you to input any text into the console and the shift will be calculated against the stored dictionary. 
```bash
./decrypt_cipher
```

#### 2. File Input
This method will allow you to input a file path. This file should be a list of strings separated by line. The script will determine the shift for the line.
**File path for testing = ./encrypted_text.txt**

```bash
cat [file_path] | ./decrypt_cipher
```

## Performance

To fit with the new assignment guidelines we are now improving the program's speed. This was done on a vmware virtual machine given 4 cores of a AMD Ryzen 2600X and 8 GB of 3200mhz RAM. The rest of the system resources remained for the host OS (Windows) to utilize while the VM ram. To test the speed of this program I used the following command:
**File path for testing = ./encrypted_text.txt**

```bash
time cat [file_path] | ./decrypt_cipher
```

## Other Files
The python files in the project directory were used by me to develop solutions to the project. I did this because I am much more comfortable in python than C so I was able to better understand how to solve the problem.

Using the text file provided by the TA, I was able to confirm the first 50 solutions generated by my script matched the expected output.
