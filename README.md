# TODO

1. Edit this file to be your own readme. In other words, document your code here.

2. Create a make file in this directory that will create a binary file that my script can run and call it `ceaser.o`. 

3. Read the pdf within this file and make sense of what the assignment is.

4. Message Jack or George on Teams if there are any issues
